Visitors are typically treated as welcome guests, but etiquette is shaped by Betazoid sensitivity—privacy, emotional honesty, and consent matter more than formal protocol.\n\nMost hard logistics (permits, ports, and formal entry rules) are not described on screen; what the canon emphasizes instead is the lived experience of Betazoid society: intimate, candid, and often disarmingly direct.",
